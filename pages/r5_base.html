                <h4>The R5 Base</h4>
                <p>The R5 base is great for beginners looking for an affordable direct drive base.<br>While not a lot, the 5 newton meters of force the base provides is still enough to have plenty of fun.<br>My only real gripe is how quickly the base heats up during use, so much so that I have had it overheat and shut off, fortunately it was only once but it does get concerning at times.</p>
